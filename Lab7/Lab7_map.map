Phase 2.7  Design Feasibility Check
WARNING:Place:916 - Local congestion has been detected on component outPin_OBUF.
   There is a limitation that at most 2 global signals can drive non-clock pins
   per CLB. The placer has detected that component outPin_OBUF has 3 non-clock
   pins driven by global signals. Placement will continue but note that this
   situation may lead to an unroutable situation. 
ERROR:Place:1136 - This design contains a global buffer instance,
   <sck00/clkout2_buf>, driving the net, <clk2>, that is driving the following
   (first 30) non-clock load pins.
   < PIN: Mmux_outPin11.A2; >
   This is not a recommended design practice in Spartan-6 due to limitations in
   the global routing that may cause excessive delay, skew or unroutable
   situations.  It is recommended to only use a BUFG resource to drive clock
   loads. If you wish to override this recommendation, you may use the
   CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint (given below) in the .ucf file to demote
   this message to a WARNING and allow your design to continue.
   < PIN "sck00/clkout2_buf.O" CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE = FALSE; >
