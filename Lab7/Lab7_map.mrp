Interim Summary
---------------
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                     0 out of  11,440    0%
  Number of Slice LUTs:                          1 out of   5,720    1%
    Number used as logic:                        1 out of   5,720    1%
      Number using O6 output only:               1
      Number using O5 output only:               0
      Number using O5 and O6:                    0
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   1,440    0%

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of MUXCYs used:                         0 out of   2,860    0%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:            1
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:             1 out of       1  100%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of       1    0%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:           0 out of       1    0%
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               0 out of  11,440    0%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

Design Summary
--------------
Number of errors   :   4
Number of warnings :   1

Section 1 - Errors
------------------
ERROR:Place:1136 - This design contains a global buffer instance,
   <sck00/clkout2_buf>, driving the net, <clk2>, that is driving the following
   (first 30) non-clock load pins.
   < PIN: Mmux_outPin11.A2; >
   This is not a recommended design practice in Spartan-6 due to limitations in
   the global routing that may cause excessive delay, skew or unroutable
   situations.  It is recommended to only use a BUFG resource to drive clock
   loads. If you wish to override this recommendation, you may use the
   CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint (given below) in the .ucf file to demote
   this message to a WARNING and allow your design to continue.
   < PIN "sck00/clkout2_buf.O" CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE = FALSE; >

ERROR:Place:1136 - This design contains a global buffer instance,
   <sck00/clkout3_buf>, driving the net, <clk3>, that is driving the following
   (first 30) non-clock load pins.
   < PIN: Mmux_outPin11.A5; >
   This is not a recommended design practice in Spartan-6 due to limitations in
   the global routing that may cause excessive delay, skew or unroutable
   situations.  It is recommended to only use a BUFG resource to drive clock
   loads. If you wish to override this recommendation, you may use the
   CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint (given below) in the .ucf file to demote
   this message to a WARNING and allow your design to continue.
   < PIN "sck00/clkout3_buf.O" CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE = FALSE; >

ERROR:Place:1136 - This design contains a global buffer instance,
   <sck00/clkout1_buf>, driving the net, <clk1>, that is driving the following
   (first 30) non-clock load pins.
   < PIN: Mmux_outPin11.A4; >
   This is not a recommended design practice in Spartan-6 due to limitations in
   the global routing that may cause excessive delay, skew or unroutable
   situations.  It is recommended to only use a BUFG resource to drive clock
   loads. If you wish to override this recommendation, you may use the
   CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint (given below) in the .ucf file to demote
   this message to a WARNING and allow your design to continue.
   < PIN "sck00/clkout1_buf.O" CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE = FALSE; >

ERROR:Pack:1654 - The timing-driven placement phase encountered an error.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:Place:916 - Local congestion has been detected on component outPin_OBUF.
   There is a limitation that at most 2 global signals can drive non-clock pins
   per CLB. The placer has detected that component outPin_OBUF has 3 non-clock
   pins driven by global signals. Placement will continue but note that this
   situation may lead to an unroutable situation. 

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
INFO:Pack:1716 - Initializing temperature to 85.000 Celsius. (default - Range:
   0.000 to 85.000 Celsius)
INFO:Pack:1720 - Initializing voltage to 1.140 Volts. (default - Range: 1.140 to
   1.260 Volts)
INFO:Map:215 - The Interim Design Summary has been generated in the MAP Report
   (.mrp).
